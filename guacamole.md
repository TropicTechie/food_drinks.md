# Guacamole

Guacamole is best prepared and eaten fresh, but can chill for max 2 hours before serving.

Here is my recipe to help you out.

## What you need

- 3 Ripe Avocados 
- 1/2 Small Onion
- 2 Roma Tomatoes
- 3 tbsp finely chopped fresh Cilantro
- 2 Garlic Cloves
- 1 Lime
- 1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt
- 1 JalapeÃ±o pepper _(optional)_


> [!TIP]
> **How to choose a ripe avocado ðŸ¥‘**
> 
>  To find a perfectly ripe avocado, just use the squeeze test.
> 
> - If you gently squeeze the avocado and itâ€™s hard, itâ€™s not ripe enough.
> - If it yields slightly to pressure, **that's your avocado!**
> - On the other hand, if it makes a large indentation, thatâ€™s a sign your avocado is overripe, _**you don't want these**_.

## How to Make

- Finely dice your onion and tomatoes, I like to do these about a 1/4".
    - If you are using peppers, dice those up also.
- Finely dice your garlic _(super fine)_ or use a garlic press.
- Cut, deseed and scoop avocados into a mixing bowl.
- Mash avocados with a potato smasher, chunky level is up to you.
- Add the rest of the ingredients in the bowl with your avocado and mix well with a spoon.
    - Add more salt, pepper or lime to fit your taste profile.
- Serve your Guac with tortilla chips and an ice cold beer.
    - Corona or Modelo Negra pair good with this treat, as does a Pilsner.
